# travelManagerProject2

## Description
This is a travel management system that will take user info, create an available booking, and output a file for project details. 
OOP concepts and file management is being implemented.

## Key Concepts in Practice

1. Exploring Object Oriented Programming and creating Classess to define tasks and objects of the application.
2. Accessing class private variables using accessors and mutators. Protect data from other classess.
3. Inharetance of classes, to reuse code and achieve polymorphism.
4. Static Variables to save variables that will be needed in other classes and keep data within scope.
5. Organization of classess using header files.

## Note

This project is based on the tutorial found at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=viSEf6o0ibs. I took the tutorial one step further and 
implemented better coding practices. This includes, setters and getters, data verification, and file organization.
